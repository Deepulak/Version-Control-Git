Prepare the files for the first commit using the
following command: git add
src/lib/compute.py

Commit the files using the following command: git
commit ­-m "Initial commit"


You can push the repository files to the repository on
GitHub using the following command: git push ­u
origin master

start from GITHUB ETIQUETTE

ACTIVITY 1: CREATING A REPOSITORY start from there

1. Create a branch to host this modification by using the
following command:
git branch ft­add­encapsulating­class

git checkout ft­add­encapsulating­class

ft: Use this prefix for a feature branch.
bg: This prefix should be used for bug branches.
fx: The fx prefix is utilized to identify a branch for
rolling out hotfixes.
ch: This prefix is used for chore branches. Chores
refer to tasks like styling code and rearranging files
in a repository.

12. Push the changes made to a remote branch by using
the following command:
git push origin ft­add­encapsulating­class

1. git diff ­­ src/lib/
2. git diff ­­ src/lib/compute.py
(1) and (2) compare the version in the working directory
of the specified paths to the version that's present in the
index.

1. git diff HEAD ­­ src/
2. git diff
f4e4e8d5b292dc94468b6f88223cac4f55c03713
­­ src/lib/
3. git diff master
(1) Compares the version in the working directory ofthe src directory, to the version of the most recent
commit on the current branch.
(2) Compares the version in the working directory of
the src directory to the version in the snapshot
represented by the hash
f4e4e8d5b292dc94468b6f88223cac4f55c03713.
(3) Compares the version in the working directory of
the src directory to the version at the tip of the
branch master.
